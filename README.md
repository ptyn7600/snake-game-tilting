# Tilting Snake Game

## Short Description
In this project, a snake game is built with the help of an Arduino as a microcontroller. In addition to control the snake with a joystick, we can move the snake by tilting the screen. All the codes are written using Arduino IDE. More details about the project can be found in the [wiki page](https://github.com/ptyn7600/snake-game-tilting/wiki).
